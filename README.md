This entire project is me getting up and running with Python and whatever other
manner of programming language I care to utilize and/or play around with. I
intend for my first TRUE project to be a web app that will help me with my
Elder Scrolls: Oblivion alchemy.  In the mean time, I'm just learning and playing
with Python under the super-serious and uber-watchful eye of my good fried Erik.
Say hello, Erik!!

To my supports; thank you! To my haters; at least I give you something to do. ^_-
